Don't ask why. Sometimes my mind wonders to strange places.

### Shrekification.

At work today I developed a way for administrators for our website to view the site as a general user to help with troubleshooting user's issues. 
Seems like a good idea. Click a link, modify the administrator's permissions to be a user and give them a new fake permission to allow them to see a new
link that can return them to their original state. The link was simply titled "View as user."

Well... not even a minute after finishing this task I thought, why not "View as shrek." Thus, Shrekify.js was born. Create a link with the Id "Shrekify"
and reference the css and javascript to view your new shrekified page. 

You can see a working link on my site. There is no way to toggle back unless you refresh the page because... why would you ever want to toggle back?

Enjoy.

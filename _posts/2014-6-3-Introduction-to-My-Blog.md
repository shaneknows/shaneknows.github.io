title: Introduction to My Blog
---

Hey there! I'm still working out learning all this Jekyll stuff, but I hope to get this blog up and running soon.

### What's to come?

* Exploration and evaluation of random projects on [GitHub](http://github.com)
* An explanation of some of my own personal projects as I develop. Mostly games and web stuff such as [Naifu](https://github.com/shaneknows/Naifu)
* Some interesting .NET tricks I discover through personal work
* Other tips and tricks for any aspiring developer
* Really anything code-centric

    <p>It has been quite some time. I’m starting a new mobile app to track match up statistics for any type of competitive game.</p>

<h3 id="wait-what-why">Wait. What? Why?</h3>

<p>For a good bit of my life I have been playing video games. It basically got me interested in the things that brought me down my career path. 
Lately I have been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U semi-competitively. My friend showed me an excel file he was using to track his wins/ losses
against certain characters. I have also heard of professional players keeping a log on their phones of specific match up tips for each character they play against or 
even match up strategies for specific players. So I thought, why not create a nice pretty app to track all of that? </p>

<p>Here are my goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Apache Cordova to create an application that will run across most mobile platforms.</li>
  <li>Allow users to break down entries by Game Name -&gt; Player’s Character -&gt; Opponent’s Character</li>
  <li>At the Opponent’s Character level, be able to simply add/subtract wins and losses.</li>
  <li>Ability to select the Opponent’s Character level and add notes that can be viewed later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now I have just created the basic Hello, World application you get when you install all of Apache Cordova extension. 
<a href="https://github.com/shaneknows/MatchUpTrackr">You can check it out here</a></p>

<p>Hopefully in a week or so I will have the XML reading and writing set up so there will be some actual functionality.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

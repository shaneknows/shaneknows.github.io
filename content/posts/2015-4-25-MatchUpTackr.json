It basically got me interested in the things that brought me down my career path. \r\nLately I have been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U semi-competitively. My friend showed me an excel file he was using to track his wins/ losses\r\nagainst certain characters. I have also heard of professional players keeping a log on their phones of specific match up tips for each character they play against or \r\neven match up strategies for specific players. So I thought, why not create a nice pretty app to track all of that? \r\n\r\nHere are my goals:\r\n\r\n* Use Apache Cordova to create an application that will run across most mobile platforms.\r\n* Allow users to break down entries by Game Name -> Player's Character -> Opponent's Character\r\n* At the Opponent's Character level, be able to simply add/subtract wins and losses.\r\n* Ability to select the Opponent's Character level and add notes that can be viewed later.\r\n\r\nRight now I have just created the basic Hello, World application you get when you install all of Apache Cordova extension. \r\n[You can check it out here](https://github.com/shaneknows/MatchUpTrackr)\r\n\r\nHopefully in a week or so I will have the XML reading and writing set up so there will be some actual functionality.\r\n\r\nUntil next time.",

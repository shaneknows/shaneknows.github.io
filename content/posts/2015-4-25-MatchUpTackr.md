It has been quite some time. I'm starting a new mobile app to track match up statistics for any type of competitive game.

### Wait. What? Why?

For a good bit of my life I have been playing video games. It basically got me interested in the things that brought me down my career path. 
Lately I have been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U semi-competitively. My friend showed me an excel file he was using to track his wins/ losses
against certain characters. I have also heard of professional players keeping a log on their phones of specific match up tips for each character they play against or 
even match up strategies for specific players. So I thought, why not create a nice pretty app to track all of that? 

Here are my goals:

* Use Apache Cordova to create an application that will run across most mobile platforms.
* Allow users to break down entries by Game Name -> Player's Character -> Opponent's Character
* At the Opponent's Character level, be able to simply add/subtract wins and losses.
* Ability to select the Opponent's Character level and add notes that can be viewed later.

Right now I have just created the basic Hello, World application you get when you install all of Apache Cordova extension.

Hopefully in a week or so I will have the XML reading and writing set up so there will be some actual functionality.

Until next time.
